# Where Should I Live?

In this project my goal is to learn how to use Flask, Bokeh, and GeoPandas to create an interactive tool that can be used to find a user's top location recommendations for where to move/live in the continental United States, given a user's preferences. I was inspired to create this because I am currently relocating and wished there was an aggregated source to visualize my preferences for things that matter to me when choosing a state and city to move to and live and thrive in.
